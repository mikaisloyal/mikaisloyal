## Hi, I'm Jasmine! You can call me Jazzyyy!

🎓 I'm currently a Bachelor's student studying Data Analytics and Computer Science. I am passionate about honing my skills in these fields and would love to connect over internship opportunities.

🍳 Apart from studies, I have a keen interest in cooking. Feel free to share your favorite recipes!

🎥 I'm also a big anime fan. Let's swap anime watch lists!

Looking forward to connecting with you!
